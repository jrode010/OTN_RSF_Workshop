    "text": "Lucas Griffin (University of South Florida, USA)\nJonathan Rodemann (Florida International University, USA) – jrodeman@fiu.edu\n\n\n\nRobert Lennox (OTN)\n\n\n\nWelcome to our Resource Selection Function workshop! The goal of this workshop is to familiarize participants with the concept of RSFs, present case studies within aquatic acoustic telemetry, and how to run the analyses in R. We will start the workshop by providing background and theory on RSFs. We will then present multiple case studies using RSFs from our and other’s work in aquatic telemetry systems. These case studies will be followed a walkthrough of the data and R code used to conduct RSFs using Random Forest, Generalized Linear, and Generalized Additive Models. R scripts are provided to encourage participants to conduct Resource Selection Functions on their own acoustic data.\n\nResource selection functions (RSFs), defined as a function that produces values that are proportional to the probability of use by an animal, are a popular method to determine and predict relative habitat selection by animals. These functions evaluate the relationships between resource use (i.e., the units of area selected by an animal) and the environmental characteristics associated with each unit of area. Animal spatial data, from sources such as telemetry, can be incorporated into RSFs to define the relative habitat selection strengths among animal space use and a given set of environmental covariates, such as habitat type, substrate, elevation, or water depth. When the true absences are unknown, as generated by presence only data derived from sources such as telemetry approaches, RSFs are implemented within a use/availability framework where known presences (1) are compared with a random sample across ‘available’ resource units, also known as pseudo-absences or background points (0). Alternative to use/availability (e.g., from telemetry), data from observations collected from survey methods, often without timestamps, are typically referred to as presence-background and are fitted as species distribution models. Using RSFs to derive the relative probability of selection, rather than the absolute probability, telemetry data are then typically fitted using logistic regression models or, as of more recently, with machine learning algorithms [e.g., random forest (RF), boosted regression trees].\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop GitHub – Website that houses data and code for our RSF workshop\n\nWorkshop slides\n\n\nManly et al. 2007.
